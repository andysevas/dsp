# Learn command line

Please follow and complete the free online [Command Line Crash Course
tutorial](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/). This is a great,
quick tutorial. Each "chapter" focuses on a command. Type the commands
you see in the _Do This_ section, and read the _You Learned This_
section. Move on to the next chapter. You should be able to go through
these in a couple of hours.

###Q1.  Cheat Sheet of Commands  

Make a cheat sheet for yourself: a list of at least **ten** commands and what they do, focused on things that are new, interesting, or otherwise worth remembering.

pwd = print working directory.  Arguable the most important one  
cd = change directory  
ls = list directory, i.e. 'what's in this folder' 
pushd = moving to a different directory temporarily
popd = 'pop' off and come back to the directory you were on
mkdir = make directory
rmdir = remove directory.  Note that you can't remove a non-empty directory
touch = make a new file.  For Mac.  You need to include the file name.
grep = a search function for files whose name matches a pattern.  Kind of like regular expressions.
mv = renames a file.  It implies it's "moving" it but this one is clearer if you think of it as renaming.

###Q2.  List Files in Unix   

What do the following commands do:  
`ls`  
Lists the directories

`ls -a`  
Shows all files, including hidden files

`ls -l`  
Gives the "long" description of the files, with info on permissions and sizes and dates

`ls -lh`  
Same as -l, but with unit suffixes for the file size

`ls -lah`  
Combines all three of the above.

`ls -t`  
Sorts files by time modified.

`ls -Glp`  
Adds color to the names of the directories and a "/" after their name.  Also in long format.

`ls -s` sorts by file size  
`ls -r` shows in reverse order  
`ls -R` shows all the sub directories, all the way down  
`ls ..` shows the parent directory  
`ls *.txt` returns all the text files like a wild card function
